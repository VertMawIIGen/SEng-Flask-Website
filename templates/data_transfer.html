                    <p>You may not realize it, but on average, roughly one petabyte of data is actively being
                        transferred over the internet every second (that's about <em>one million gigabytes</em>). With
                        this much data, it is paramount that there is a way to ensure that data is being transferred
                        reliably, accurately and in a timely manner. But before we can worry about that, we also have to
                        know where the data is even going. These are the jobs of data packets and IP addresses
                        respectively, and they are discussed right below.
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="title1" class="title">What are data packets?</h4>
                    <p>A data packet is a small portion of data taken from a larger file that is transmitted from one
                        device to another via a network,
                        such as the internet. Data packets are used to break down large files into smaller, more
                        manageable units that can be sent in any order and reassembled by the receiver's device at the
                        destination,
                        also known as the <em>endpoint</em>.
                        Alongside the transported data (also known as the <strong>payload</strong>), most data transfer
                        protocols also send a packet header, which
                        contains metadata specifying the receiver's IP address, the protocol used to transfer the
                        data, and other relevant information, such as the origin, content and destination of the data.
                        <br> <br>

                        While it is theoretically possible to transfer files as one continuous stream of data using a
                        method called circuit switching, such a
                        solution is impractical in computer networks, which are groups of two or more connected
                        computers.
                        Without breaking down the files, computers within the network would need to take turns to
                        receive and transmit data, making it exponentially slower the more devices there are in the
                        network and thus impractical for the operation of the internet.

                        <br><br>

                        Therefore, data packets are used in order to allow
                        multiple computers to simultaneously receive data by reducing the size of the data transferred
                        at one time and making each packet independent of one another such that data from different
                        devices can be transferred at the same on the same infrastructure, thereby making it faster and
                        more efficient for the many devices on the internet. The way that this
                        can be achieved is by using a technique called <strong>packet switching</strong>.

                        <br> <br>

                        Packet switching is a data transmission method in which a message is broken into a number of
                        parts (which are the data packets) and then sent independently, over whatever route is optimum
                        for each packet, and reassembled at the destination. In the context of the internet (which is in
                        essence a network of networks), packets travel through various network nodes, such as routers
                        and switches, and arrives at its intended location. By allowing packets to be transferred at
                        their optimum routes, this reduces the overall strain on network infrastructure and hastens the
                        data transfer process, as packets are able to be routed around congested networks, leading to a
                        more efficient usage of network resources. Packet switching allows multiple devices to transfer
                        and use the network infrastructure as packets can be processed independent to one another,
                        allowing the network nodes to facilitate connections with multiple devices at once.


                        <br> <br>
                        Packet switching forms the basis of the modern protocol used in data transmissions today, called
                        the TCP/IP protocol. The Transmission Control Protocol is responsible for assembling the packets
                        in
                        the right order and ensuring accuracy of transmission, and the Internet Protocol is responsible
                        for allowing communications to exist
                        between devices on the internet (more regarding them below).

                                original data at the endpoint.

                    <p>Electronic Commerce, also more commonly known as E-commerce, refers to the concept of trading
                        good and services over the internet. The term "e-commerce" does not just refer to the trading of
                        items, rather it also refers more broadly to many aspects of the service, such as the
                        electronic provision of support services for customers, such as online customer service, the
                        marketing
                        and developing of goods, and the delivering of products to purchasers. There are different types
                        of e-commerce, based on who orders the goods and services, and who sold the goods and

                                                <li>Online intermediaries are companies that serve as the bridge between
                                                    potential consumers and companies. They do not own any of the
                                                    products or services, only serving as the platform or marketplace
                                                    for buyers and sellers to come together and interact. An example of
                                                    such a company is Amazon.

                                                <li>Fee-based companies sell their software products to consumers using
                                                    a subscription model. Software-as-a-service businesses use this
                                                    model, as well as other products such as streaming services, like

                                    The C2B model involves a consumer offering their products and services to companies,
                                    with both the company and the consumer benefiting from the relationship. This model
                                    exists when the consumer creates value, and the business consumes the value. This
                                    business model is atypical, and not as common as the other business models, as it
                                    the consumer that offers their products an services to businesses for payment or
                                    other benefits.

                                    An example of this would be when a consumer runs a blogging channel,
                                    and offers to advertise a company's product in exchange for funds.

                                    platform. Companies that follow the C2C model do not sell their own goods, rather

                                    Ebay or Gumtree follow this model of e-commerce.

                    <h4 id="title3" class="title">Progressive Web Applications (PWAs)</h4>
                    <p>Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) are special applications that are, in essence, web
                        applications that operate similarly to native applications. They can be thought of as a mix
                        between traditional websites and native applications, combining the accessibility of a website
                        with the user experience of an application. Now, you might be wondering, what even are webs
                        application and native applications?</p>

                    <h5>Web Applications</h5>
                    <p>A web application is an application that is hosted on a web server and can be accessed from a
                        browser through the internet or an intranet. It is not installed and run on the computer, rather
                        its processes are executed on a server which the browser communicates with. <br><br> It is
                        important to note that web applications are distinct from traditional websites. This is because
                        they have a higher level of complexity and interactivity, and are designed for interaction by
                        end users, rather than having only static content, which traditional websites have. In web
                        applicatiions, the user is capable of reading and manipulating data, while in traditional
                        websites, the user can only read the data available.</p>

                    <h5>Native Applications</h5>

                    <p>Native applications are those developed specifically for a certain operating system. They are
                        developed in accordance with the nuances of each specific platform, which can include Linux or
                        windows.</p>

                    <h5>How they relate to PWAs.</h5>
                    <p>PWAs bridge the gap between the web applications and native applications by providing web
                        applications with native application functionality, such as sending push notifications and
                        accessing system resources. They work by using a service worker, which allows PWAs to run in the
                        background without the need to reside in the browser. When the application is installed, the
                        service worker, along with the cache, is installed. This allows PWAs to be used offline as the
                        content is loaded from the cache, with the cache being updated whenever internet access in
                        available.</p>

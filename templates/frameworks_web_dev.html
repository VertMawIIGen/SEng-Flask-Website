                    <p>There are many aspects of designing and developing web applications, with small things such as
                        the browser developer tools and the IDE being capable of influencing the quality of work. There
                        are many things that can help simplify the process of collaborating and developing application,
                        such as the things listed below:
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="title1" class="title">Browser Developer Tools</h4>
                    <p>
                        Virtually any browser that one uses (be it Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.) has the option to show a
                        tool menu called the developer tools. The <strong>Developer Tools menu</strong> within all
                        browsers allows
                        programmers to view the underlying structure of the webpage (by showing the Document Object
                        Model) and also allows them to modify code to view changes in real-time. Developer tools also
                        allow programmers to inspect and debug code, making it an overall an essential tool for web
                        developers. <br><br>
                        There are different tabs within the developer tools, all of which show different things and have
                        different functionalities. These are labeled differently in every browser, but each browser’s
                        developer tools should:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Contain a way to inspect the DOM and CSS of the current webpage:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Developer tools allow you to inspect and modify (though not permanently) the HTML
                                    (represented as a DOM) and CSS of the website that is currently being displayed.
                                    This allows developers to experiment with different styles and layouts, with changes
                                    being applied in real-time. The developers can also experience the website’s changes
                                    within the intended browser without needing to modify the actual code, thus
                                    simplifying the
                                    experimentation process and allowing developers to easily simulate the user’s
                                    experience.

                                    <br><br>
                                    Additionally, inspecting the CSS within dev tools allows developers to find unused
                                    and redundant CSS, allowing them to more easily find and remove redundancies.

                                </li>
                            </ul>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Allow programmers to view and utilize the Javascript console and debugger:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    The Javascript console within the developer tools enables developers to debug the
                                    Javascript code within the source code that is not working properly. The console
                                    allows developers to run single or multiple lines of Javascript code against the
                                    page that is currently loaded within the browser and outputs error messages for code
                                    that fails to run. <br><br>
                                    The Debugger feature allows developers to set breakpoints (stopping execution at a
                                    certain line) and watch expressions (seeing what is contained in certain variables)
                                    in order to better understand the execution of code in order to find and rectify
                                    errors that it may contain. The debugger contains valuable information such as the
                                    scope (which lists all the variables that a certain line can see) and the call stack
                                    (which shows the code that was executed to get to the current line) which aid
                                    developers in determining the cause of an error that they are encountering. <br><br>
                                    Additionally, the Javascript debugger also allows developers to find unused
                                    Javascript, allowing them to remove redundant code, which can help optimize the file
                                    size.
                                </li>

                        <li>
                            <strong> Allow programmers to view a network monitor:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    The network monitor allows developers to analyze network requests and show all
                                    resources that are being downloaded or uploaded by the website. The network monitor
                                    shows how long each resource takes to download and the details of each resource,
                                    such that developers are capable of optimizing website performance and determining
                                    any bottlenecks that exist within the website. <br>
                                    Additionally, the network tab also allows developers to throttle the speed of
                                    internet, in order to mimic the experience of users with low internet speeds,
                                    further allowing them to identify bottlenecks that contribute to slow loading and
                                    optimize their website to accommodate for slower internet speeds.
                                </li>

                                    Performance tools detail how the page performs while running, showing metrics such
                                    as frames per second, and the time it takes to run certain process to give a general
                                    overview of how the webpage performs when it is running, as opposed to when it is
                                    loading. <br>
                                    Additionally, developer tools in the Chrome browser allows developers to the
                                    throttle the performance of their CPU in order to mimic the operation of the system
                                    for mobile devices, further helping identify bottlenecks and helping optimize the
                                    website.

                                    Some browsers have an accessibility option in their developer tools, which allows
                                    the developer to view all elements of the webpage that are related to assistive
                                    technologies, such as for alternate text for images and the tabbing order of the
                                    website. <br>
                                    This helps them identify elements of the page that are not suitably easily
                                    accessible for impaired individuals, which helps in improving the accessibility of
                                    the webpage.

                    <h4 id="title2" class="title">Other Notable Influences of the Browser</h4>
                    <p>
                        Due to the existence of many browsers within the internet, when developing applications, it is
                        important to consider that these browsers do not have the same underlying code. Different
                        browsers can have differing implementations regarding how they approach certain core elements.
                        Consequently, developers would need to ensure that the code that they write are compatible with
                        the majority of these browsers, taking into account the following differences:

                                    <strong>Rendering Engines</strong> are a core part of the browser that transforms
                                    HTML, CSS and other
                                    files into their visual representations that users see on the screen. It is
                                    responsible for interpretation of the code that developers write, and since not all
                                    browsers have the same rendering engine (for example, Firefox has <em>Gecko</em>,
                                    Safari has
                                    <em>WebKit</em>) it is essential that developers account for the nuances within each
                                    engine,
                                    such that the website loads correctly regardless of the user’s platform. <br><br>
                                    This can be done through the testing and debugging of the website across multiple
                                    browsers in order to find and resolve issues regarding rendering, or by checking
                                    online resources that verify the compatibility of certain HTML elements prior to
                                    implementation in the website.

                                    their different implementations, with V8 compiling straight to machine code and
                                    SpiderMonkey compiling to an intermediate language first. <br>As a result,

                                    code that works on one browser may not necessarily work flawlessly on another,
                                    meaning that developers would need to <strong>test their code on multiple
                                    platforms</strong> to
                                    ensure its compatibility.

                        have to take into account the nuances, there exists techniques that developers can use to make
                        this process simpler, including:

                        <li>
                            <strong>Sticking to the Standards Imposed by the W3C</strong>

                                    Almost all commonly used web browsers adhere to standards outlined by the W3C and
                                    other similar organizations which aim to standardize the implementation of HTML, CSS
                                    and Javascript. This means that, by following the guidelines, developers would be
                                    able to ensure that their code works for almost every browser.
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    Languages like CSS contain inbuilt features that can detect whether a browser
                                    has the capability to show or understand certain elements within code. For example,
                                    CSS has an inbuilt function that allows developers to add a <em>@supports</em> rule
                                    in order
                                    to ensure compatibility with browsers, particularly older browsers, by allowing them
                                    to have alternative methods to render a particular element. <br><br>
                                    By utilizing these features, developers are able to stagnate the rollout of features
                                    that implement new technologies that may not be supported by all browsers in order
                                    to ensure that older browsers are still able to access and use their website, in
                                    line with a web design strategy called progressive enhancement, which is the idea
                                    that everyone should have access to the bare content, and only compatible devices
                                    should be shown the more enhanced version of the website.

                        Version control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code, made
                        possible through the use of version control systems (VCS). Version control comes with several benefits,

                        Code libraries provide pre-written, modular, and reusable code that can be easily utilized in
                        order to speed up development and ensure the reliability and maintainability of an application.
                        Code libraries have different types: namely frameworks, template engines and pre-designed CSS
                        classes, all of which follow the same concept but are designed for different applications.

                                    <strong>Frameworks</strong>, such as Flask, are a set of pre-written code that serve
                                    as the structure
                                    on which the code can be incorporated in order to create a new web application.
                                    Frameworks act as modifiable templates that allow programmers to avoid writing
                                    commonly implemented functionality and instead focus on their own code for the

                                    The utilization of frameworks come with notable benefits:

                                    <strong>Template engines</strong> allow developers to <em>dynamically generate</em>
                                    HTML pages based on the
                                    content and the HTML “template” that is provided to the template engine. In this
                                    way, the programmer would not have to manually change the HTML page every time new
                                    content is added, with them only needing to pass content into the template engine,
                                    which would then dynamically generate the required HTML page. <br><br>
                                    Template engines like Jinja work by <em>replacing variables</em> in the template
                                    file with
                                    the actual values provided in the content, also incorporating <em>control
                                    structures</em>,
                                    such as loops, to further make this process simpler and more extensible. The
                                    template engine
                                    thus transforms the template file into an actual HTML file which is then sent to the
                                    user for their browser to render. <br><br>
                                    The advantage with using template engines is that it <strong>promotes code
                                    organization</strong> by
                                    separating the content from the code. In this way, the developer who works on the
                                    website does not need to worry about the content that another developer is working
                                    on, only needing to create a template that does not need to be continuously updated.
                                    The separation of concerns and maintenance allows code to become more <strong>maintainable
                                    and extensible </strong>over time.

                                    <strong>Pre-designed CSS classes</strong> such as Bootstrap are collections of

                                    offer reusable code for common elements of a webpage, such as for buttons, grids and
                                    navigation menus. It does this by providing predefined CSS classes that allow
                                    programmers to simply reference and utilize specific styling, to minimize or
                                    eliminate the need for the programmer to code create his own CSS. Pre-designed CSS
                                    classes also allow for websites to become more responsive, meaning that users on
                                    different devices would still be capable of utilizing the website, thereby making it

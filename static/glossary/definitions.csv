Interactive Websites; Interactive websites are websites that are designed to produce real-time and engaging experiences for the user by allowing them to "interact" with the content within the webpage.
E-Commerce; E-Commerce is the purchasing, selling and exchanging of goods and services through internet-based platforms, also encompassing the marketing, support, development and delivery of goods.
Progressive Web Applications; Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) are web applications that are designed to be able to run similar to a native application in that it can send notifications and access system resources in order to run in the background.
Web Applications; Web applications are applications hosted on a web server that can be accessed through the internet via the user's browser. All processes are executed on the server.
Native Applications; Native applications are applications that are developed specifically for a particular operating system and require the user to download to utilize.
Endpoint; An endpoint refers to a specific device or node that connects to a network and is the target for a data transfer.
Payload; A payload refers to the section of a data packet that contains the actual data that it is sending.
Data Packets; Data packets are small portions of a larger file that is used to transmit information from one side to another via a network, such as the internet. Typically, it contains a header, a trailer, and the payload.
Packet Switching; Packet switching is a data transmission method where data is broken down into data packets and sent independently to the endpoint.
Routers; Routers are networking devices that manage the flow of the data packets for one or more packet switched networks.
Switches; Switches are devices that connects devices together to form a network.
IP Address; IP addresses are unique strings of characters (that consists of 4 8 bit numbers separated by dots in IPv4) that serves as a unique identifier for every device that connects to the internet, such that data can be easily transferred to the particular device.
Domain Name; Domain names are human-readable addresses that are used to uniquely identify a specific website.
Domain Name System (DNS); Domain Name System (DNS) is a method that is used to translate domain names into IP addresses, through a process called DNS resolution, such that the device can communicate with the web server.
Recursive Servers; Recursive servers query authoritative servers on behalf to the end user in order to find the IP address that is correlated to a domain name.
Authoritative Servers; Authoritative servers contain the actual information regarding the IP address that maps to the domain name.
Encryption;Encryption is the process of altering data into a form that can only be read by the intended individuals.
Plaintext;Plaintext refers to unmodified data that can be read directly by devices or humans without the need to decrypt.
Encryption Key;An encryption key is a string of characters or numbers that is used by encryption algorithms to encrypt and decrypt data in a way that is unique to the specific string, meaning that users require the same exact string in order to correctly read encrypted data.
Encryption algorithm; The encryption algorithm is a algorithm that is used to convert plaintext into ciphertext and back into plaintext through the use of the encryption key.
Symmetric encryption algorithms; Encryption algorithms that use the same key for both the encryption and decryption process.
Asymmetric encryption; Encryption algorithms that use two keys, one for decryption (private key) and the other for decryption (public key).
Authentication;Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or entity, in order to ensure that the person attempting to access the system is the correct person, and not a malicious individual pretending to be the real user.
Authorization;Authorization is the process of ensuring that an already authenticated user has the ability to perform a specific action or view a specific resource within the web server.
Digital signatures;Digital signatures are documents that provide irrefutable evidence that a sender sent them as they are encrypted using the sender's private key.
Hash function; hash function is a one-way function that maps data of an arbitrary size to a fixed length set of values, known as a hash value.
Big data;Big data refers to data sets that are too large and complex for traditional database solutions to handle effectively.
Structured Data;Structured data refers to highly organized information whose trends can be easily identified and the relevant data searched.
Unstructured data;Unstructured data refers to disorganized data that contains no predefined structure, making it a challenge for software to identify trends and search for specific data.
Data mining;Data mining is the process of sorting through large data sets to identify hidden patterns and relationships that can be used by businesses to make informed decisions and predictions.
Metadata;Metadata is data that describes other data.
Internationalization;Internationalization refers to the designing of web application to function in different languages and cultural contexts.
Cross Site Scripting;Cross Site Scripting is an attack that uses the web server in order to relay malicious commands, allowing attacks to execute malicious code if the victim visits infected link or clicks on an infected portion of a website.
Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF);Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an exploit technique that involves deceiving an authenticated user to perform an unwanted action on a trusted site, exploiting their current authenticated state to perform actions that require the user to authenticate themselves prior to doing the action.
Interoperability;Interoperability between web applications refers to the ability for web applications to work together with other systems or applications.
Version Control;Version control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code, made possible through the use of version control systems (VCS).
Frameworks;Frameworks are a set of pre-written code that serves as the structure on which the code can be incorporated in order to create a new web application.
Rendering Engines; Rendering engines are responsible for interpreting the HTML, CSS and other files sent by the server into their visual representations that users see on the screen.
